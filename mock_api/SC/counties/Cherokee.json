Below is what you\u2019ll pay for drugs in each tier, based on your coverage phase.\nLearn more about drug tiers.\nTIER DRUG COST FOR\nPreferred retail pharmacy drug cost for 1 month\nChange\nCOSTS BY DRUG TIER - PREFERRED RETAIL PHARMACY DRUG COST FOR 1 MONTH\nPreferred Generic\nInitial coverage phase\n$18.00 copay\nCatastrophic coverage phase\n$0 copay\nGeneric\nInitial coverage phase\n$19.00 copay\nCatastrophic coverage phase\n$0 copay\nPreferred Brand\nInitial coverage phase\n21% coinsurance\nCatastrophic coverage phase\n$0 copay\nNon-Preferred Drug\nInitial coverage phase\n$100.00 copay\nCatastrophic coverage phase\n$0 copay\nSpecialty Tier\nInitial coverage phase\n25% coinsurance\nCatastrophic coverage phase\n$0 copay\nSelect Care Drugs\nInitial coverage phase\n$0.00 copay\nCatastrophic coverage phase\n$0 copay\nPART B DRUGS\nThese are drugs you usually get at a doctor's office or hospital outpatient setting, like the flu shot, chemotherapy, or other shots.\nPart B insulin\nIn-network: $35 copay\nLimits apply\n(Part B drugs|Part B insulin)\nChemotherapy drugs\nIn-network: 0%-20% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Part B drugs|Chemotherapy drugs)\nOther Part B drugs\nIn-network: 0%-20% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Part B drugs|Other Part B drugs)\nExtra Benefits\nHEARING\nHearing exam\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Hearing|Hearing exam)\nFitting/evaluation\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Hearing|Fitting/evaluation)\nHearing aids - prescription\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Hearing|Hearing aids - prescription)\nHearing aids - over the counter\nNot covered\nPREVENTIVE DENTAL\nCare to prevent or find problems with your teeth and gums.\nOral exam\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Preventive dental|Oral exam)\nCleaning\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Preventive dental|Cleaning)\nFluoride treatment\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Preventive dental|Fluoride treatment)\nDental x-rays\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Preventive dental|Dental x-rays)\nCOMPREHENSIVE DENTAL\nCare to maintain or treat problems with your teeth and gums.\nRestorative services\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Comprehensive dental|Restorative services)\nEndodontics\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Comprehensive dental|Endodontics)\nPeriodontics\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Comprehensive dental|Periodontics)\nProsthodontics, removable\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Comprehensive dental|Prosthodontics, removable)\nProsthodontics, fixed\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Comprehensive dental|Prosthodontics, fixed)\nMaxillofacial prosthetics\nNot covered\nImplant services\nNot covered\nOral and maxillofacial surgery\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Comprehensive dental|Oral and maxillofacial surgery)\nOrthodontics\nNot covered\nAdjunctive general services\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Comprehensive dental|Adjunctive general services)\nVISION\nRoutine eye exam\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Vision|Routine eye exam)\nContact lenses\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Vision|Contact lenses)\nEyeglasses (frames & lenses)\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Vision|Eyeglasses (frames & lenses))\nEyeglass frames only\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Vision|Eyeglass frames only)\nEyeglass lenses only\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Vision|Eyeglass lenses only)\nUpgrades\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Vision|Upgrades)\nCollapse more extra benefits\nMEDICALLY-APPROVED NON-OPIOID PAIN MANAGEMENT SERVICES\nChiropractic services\nNot covered\nAcupuncture\nNot covered\nMassage therapy\nNot covered\nAlternative therapies\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Alternative therapies)\nPlan limits - There may be limits, like the number of times you can use the item or service or how much the plan will cover.

Below is what you\u2019ll pay for drugs in each tier, based on your coverage phase.\nLearn more about drug tiers.\nTIER DRUG COST FOR\nPreferred retail pharmacy drug cost for 1 month\nChange\nCOSTS BY DRUG TIER - PREFERRED RETAIL PHARMACY DRUG COST FOR 1 MONTH\nPreferred Generic\nInitial coverage phase\n$0.00 copay\nCatastrophic coverage phase\n\u2014\nGeneric\nInitial coverage phase\n$0.00 copay\nCatastrophic coverage phase\n$0 copay\nPreferred Brand\nInitial coverage phase\n25% coinsurance\nCatastrophic coverage phase\n$0 copay\nNon-Preferred Drug\nInitial coverage phase\n34% coinsurance\nCatastrophic coverage phase\n$0 copay\nSpecialty Tier\nInitial coverage phase\n25% coinsurance\nCatastrophic coverage phase\n$0 copay\nSelect Care Drugs\nInitial coverage phase\n$0.00 copay\nCatastrophic coverage phase\n$0 copay\nPART B DRUGS\nThese are drugs you usually get at a doctor's office or hospital outpatient setting, like the flu shot, chemotherapy, or other shots.\nPart B insulin\nIn-network: $35 copay\nLimits apply\n(Part B drugs|Part B insulin)\nChemotherapy drugs\nIn-network: 0%-20% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Part B drugs|Chemotherapy drugs)\nOther Part B drugs\nIn-network: 0%-20% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Part B drugs|Other Part B drugs)\nExtra Benefits\nHEARING\nHearing exam\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Hearing|Hearing exam)\nFitting/evaluation\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Hearing|Fitting/evaluation)\nHearing aids - prescription\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Hearing|Hearing aids - prescription)\nHearing aids - over the counter\nNot covered\nPREVENTIVE DENTAL\nCare to prevent or find problems with your teeth and gums.\nOral exam\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Preventive dental|Oral exam)\nCleaning\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Preventive dental|Cleaning)\nFluoride treatment\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Preventive dental|Fluoride treatment)\nDental x-rays\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Preventive dental|Dental x-rays)\nCOMPREHENSIVE DENTAL\nCare to maintain or treat problems with your teeth and gums.\nRestorative services\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Comprehensive dental|Restorative services)\nEndodontics\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Comprehensive dental|Endodontics)\nPeriodontics\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Comprehensive dental|Periodontics)\nProsthodontics, removable\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Comprehensive dental|Prosthodontics, removable)\nProsthodontics, fixed\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Comprehensive dental|Prosthodontics, fixed)\nMaxillofacial prosthetics\nNot covered\nImplant services\nNot covered\nOral and maxillofacial surgery\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Comprehensive dental|Oral and maxillofacial surgery)\nOrthodontics\nNot covered\nAdjunctive general services\nIn-network: $0 copay\nOut-of-network: 25% coinsurance\nLimits apply\n(Comprehensive dental|Adjunctive general services)\nVISION\nRoutine eye exam\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Vision|Routine eye exam)\nContact lenses\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Vision|Contact lenses)\nEyeglasses (frames & lenses)\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Vision|Eyeglasses (frames & lenses))\nEyeglass frames only\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Vision|Eyeglass frames only)\nEyeglass lenses only\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Vision|Eyeglass lenses only)\nUpgrades\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Vision|Upgrades)\nCollapse more extra benefits\nMEDICALLY-APPROVED NON-OPIOID PAIN MANAGEMENT SERVICES\nChiropractic services\nNot covered\nAcupuncture\nNot covered\nMassage therapy\nNot covered\nAlternative therapies\nIn-network: $0 copay\nLimits apply\n(Alternative therapies)\nPlan limits - There may be limits, like the number of times you can use the item or service or how much the plan will cover.
